        <h3>Three new things I've learned about myself and my ego as a result of core learning</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In exploring my personal core values, I learned that they have informed a lot of my
            life decisions. The times when I had been really unhappy in the past can be
            attributed to being put in environments that don't affirm my core values.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            After exploring growth mindset further, I realised that my goal-oriented ego can 
            make me oblivious to the importance of the learning process. This ego sets 
            unrealistic expectations and puts pressure on itself to achieve them and so it can 
            get overwhelmed when it can't do so in a short amount of time.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Following up on the above, I have learned that daily guided mindfulness meditation 
            can help tame my less constructive egos (yes, there's more than one). It has helped 
            bring out the growth mindset attributes I already have, such as persistence and 
            embracing challenges.
          </li>
          <br>
          <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <p>
            In learning and programming, you come across people with various levels of 
            programming experience and diverse backgrounds in various facets of life. 
            Being self-aware and knowing your values can help you understand how you behave and 
            why you respond in certain ways to different things. Having empathy for others helps 
            you respond more appropriately to how others behave around you. These can help you 
            navigate the dynamics and pressures in the learning and programming environments 
            you find yourself in.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            I was suprised how much of the core learning covered concepts that I was already 
            familiar with or have at least come across previously. It's great to be part of an 
            environment that values these things. I found the core learning refreshing and 
            they provided me with much needed breaks from the technical components.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            While I'm familiar with a lot of the core learning materials, it's because I enjoy
            exploring them that I actually found it challenging to not spend too much time 
            on them. It was also challenging for me to not get trapped into overthinking things 
            with the materials.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Why do you think EDA, a programming school, spends so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
          <p>
            We're all humans and we bring our conditioning with us everywhere we go. In an 
            intense bootcamp course like EDA, students come from diverse backgrounds and are 
            put under a lot of pressure. We will be working with others heaps at EDA and need to 
            be able to do so well. The core learning material is meant to set us up with the 
            tools and awareness we need to get through bootcamp safely and well. They are also 
            useful for life in general.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning feel like a waste of time? Should 
            you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
          <p>
            As you can probably tell by now, I don't think it's a waste of time; EDA is 
            preaching to the choir when it comes to core learning with me. For starters, 
            employers look to hire people who can self-manage and work well with others. 
            I also think that the tools and habits we pick up from the core learning materials 
            will help us navigate real life circumstances including during bootcamp, at work 
            and in our personal lives.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Vision and long term goal</h3>
          <p>
            My big picture vision is to utilise the skills I have gained in web development to 
            contribute towards creating solutions for complex societal and environmental 
            problems such as inequality and climate change. There's a lot of work and steps 
            for me to figure out in order to get there. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The first step would be to start on a smaller scale of long term goal for after I 
            leave EDA. I think front end development is the path I'd like to pursue so I'll be 
            looking for work experience in this area. I think I may also need to dive into the  
            world of design thinking as interdisciplinary crossovers is where creative 
            solutions to complex matters tend to be found.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the rest, I'll have to figure it out as I progress in the web development 
            world. One thing for sure, it won't be a linear path and I expect it to involve 
            countless amount of challenges.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Strengths and limitations during bootcamp</h3>
          <p>
            I am self-motivated and I follow through on things I said I would do. These things 
            should help me through bootcamp and to develop productive working relationships 
            with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            During Foundations, I noticed that I have a tendency to overthink what steps may be  
            needed to solve challenges. I often thought I'd missed steps or that a solution 
            would be more complicated than it needs to be. I'll need to be aware when I start 
            overthinking things during bootcamp so I can pull myself back to evaluate my 
            understanding and what steps I could realistically take to solve a problem.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at bootcamp will be?</h3>
          <p>
            To be honest, I'm not sure that I'm technically ready for bootcamp, as my ability to 
            code JavaScript is very primary at the moment. Due to this, I think being able to 
            stay on top of the materials will be a challenge for me. Constantly being around 
            other people during bootcamp could be challenging half the time as I need a decent 
            amount of time on my own every day to recharge. The pressures of bootcamp would 
            also be challenging.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>What non-technical skills would you like to develop while at EDA?</h3>
          <p>
            I'd like to develop my ability to give and receive and evaluate feedback. Pair 
            programming and coding problem solving skills are also things I'd like to develop. 
            I'm also aware that I tend to internalise thoughts and things that happen around 
            me including what others do and say. I'd like to work on verbalising my thoughts  
            more when appropriate during my time at EDA.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Expectations of myself and self-management plan during bootcamp</h3>
          <p>
            My primary expectation of myself during bootcamp is that I look after my wellbeing. 
            I believe this is key to managing other expectations I have of myself around putting in 
            effort, being able to apply the materials in practice and improving my coding skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the more practical side, I will plan out slots in my calendar for EDA and coding 
            times, meal times, social breaks, exercise, mindfulness meditation and life 
            maintenance like meal prepping, laundry and grocery shopping. I'll also need to go 
            to sleep and wake up around the same time every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            This self-management plan will help me see when I may need help as usually one of 
            these things can be out of whack when I'm struggling. Looking after my wellbeing is 
            the best way to ensure I'll be able to work productively and safely with others.
          </p>
