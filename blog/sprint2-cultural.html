            <h3>Long term goal</h3>

                <p>
                Thinking of long term goal, ideally I'd like to be able to use the skills I gain from EDA to work remotely from anywhere in the world.
                This could mean working for a company that allows remote working or pursuing self-employment.
                </p>
                <p>
                On a smaller scale of long term goal, I'm also looking at the potential of pursuing a path that combines coding 
                with User Experience (UX) Design.
                This is something I'd need to look into further as it may require further training.
                </p>
                <p>
                This means that in terms of non-technical skills I'd need to work on my networking, relationship building and maintenance and intercultural skills.
                It's easy to think that working on your own would mean you don't to prioritise these skills but they are actually important when working remotely especially when
                working with people in different parts of the world.
                </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Reviewing strengths and limitations</h3>
                
                <p>
                As I'd written in my core reflections for Sprint 1, my strengths lie in being a clear communicator, self-motivated and reliable.
                I also think things through and break things down in order to tackle them which is useful when coming across coding problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                On the flip side I'm goal-oriented and can put pressure on myself to achieve a high standard of work.
                Due to this I can be dogged on achieving a level of standard I arbitrarily set for myself that may not be realistic.
                Being a highly independent person also means that when I get into this situation I may wait too long to ask for help.
                </p> 
            <br>

            <h3>Self-management plan</h3>
                
                <p>
                Reflecting on my limitations now I realise that I need to be conscious of when I start overthinking, spending too long working on something
                or trying to do something that may not be realistic.
                </p>
                <p>
                As we'll have a high workload during bootcamp and need to work to deadlines, to ensure I don't burn out and can work productively with others 
                I need to plan my days carefully. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I need to start developing a consistent routine that will include going to sleep and waking up at the same time. 
                On the more practical side I will block out slots in my calendar for EDA, meal times, social breaks, exercise, 
                meal prepping and regular life maintenance like laundry, grocery shopping etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                I've learned over the last few years that this self-management strategy is important. 
                It means I don't need to remember things that I don't need to and I'll know when to stop myself from working to do other things that are good for my wellbeing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Part of having a good self-management plan is knowing when and who to go to for help during my time at EDA.
                From now I'm giving myself the rule of thumb that if I can't figure out a solution to something in half an hour 
                I will reach out to my cohort mates, the facilitators or a friend of mine who's a developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                I expect that the facilitation team will be available to guide and support us.
                This includes by being available during their office hours and providing constructive and timely feedback.
                </p>
