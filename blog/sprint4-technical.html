        <h3>That time I got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
        <p>
          A couple of weeks ago we needed to create our blog website using HTML and CSS.
          I wanted the content sections of my index page to stack up in rows, as per the
          screenshot of my current index page below. By default, HTML stacks up web content
          elements vertically. Somehow though, I had manage to make them behave like columns
          so they were lining up next to each other instead. I just couldn't figure out how
          I had done this.
          <img src=../images/index-page-screenshot.png alt="Screenshot showing two sections of 
          the index page stacked vertically">
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few hours looking through my code and trying different ways to fix the issues
          and getting more frustrated by the minute, I decided to ask a friend in Canada to
          help me out. He had a look at my code and initially couldn't work out the problem
          either. By this time I decided I needed to sleep so I left him with the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morning came and I checked for messages from my friend. Surely enough he found the bug.
          If you remember from my previous blog, CSS changes the behaviour and look of HTML
          elements. Long story short, I had coded a few CSS properties that put all the
          sections into one box and then make them line up next to each other. All I had to do
          was remove those properties to fix the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moral of the story is, sometimes a problem isn't as complicated as you think.
          Also it's probably best not to keep coding into the obscene hours of the morning when
          you've already been coding all evening. Try sleeping on coding problems instead.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>A time I solved a problem in an elegant way</h3>
        <p>
          I wouldn't call my attempts at solving coding problems so far elegant. However, I can
          talk about when I was able to work through a challenge we were given to solve without
          wanting to tear my hair out. It was for the JS Gradebook kata in this week's sprint.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found that with this kata I was mostly able to slow down my thought process and
          break things down step-by-step. This was because I took the time to make sure I
          understood the instructions given to us for the challenge. I also went back to read
          them again when necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          I managed to complete the kata by myself using different problem solving approaches.
          I was able to find mostly the right resources through Google searches within a
          reasonable timeframe. I managed to understand the technical documentation on MDN
          Web Docs for the codes required. I used the trial and error method throughout the
          challenge. I also read through the blog linked on the kata information page which
          made me realise I needed to change something I had written in a previous code.
          <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/thedailyshow-5bivKwxhVzshNk2Rjw">

              alt="via GIPHY">
          </a>
        </p>
        I learned that when I'm able to slow down my thought process I could tackle something
        new better on my own. Although I'd also credit this to having the instructions in
        the kata information as a guide. This means that I need to work on my skills in
        breaking down a big coding challenge into smaller chunks of challenges for when I
        don't have instructions to follow.
        </p>

        <h3>Confidence levels on various problem solving approaches</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>Pseudocode : <span class="rating-tag">A little confident</span></h4>
        <p>
          When we had to do this for the Super FizzBuzz kata, I found it difficult to write
          coding steps in simple English that a human can understand i.e. pseudocode.
          This is mainly due to the fact that I didn't fully understand what I was actually meant
          to do in order to solve the challenge. I ended up writing pseudocode for another kata
          after I'd gotten a solution and found it easier to do that way. Pseudocode is a 
          valuable skill I'd like to develop so I'll see how I go with doing it again next time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Trial and error : <span class="rating-tag">Confident</span></h4>
        <p>
          Trying things is definitely my preferred approach. In the past I've taught myself to
          use heaps of different computer softwares through trial and error. In saying that,
          I've found in the last week that it can be counterproductive if not used wisely.
          At times when I'd gotten blocked I wish I'd spoken to someone else about it
          sooner to help clarify my thinking instead of festering. When the direction isn't
          so murky though, trial and error works wonders.

        <h4>Rubber ducky method : <span class="rating-tag">Not confident</span></h4>
        <p>
          This involves talking to an inanimate object like a rubber duck about what you've done
          so far, what the problem is etc. until you eventually identify the source of the problem.
          I tried to do this with the rubber ducky app on my phone for the Super FizzBuzz kata but
          as I didn't have a decent understanding of what I was meant to do, it was a fruitless
          attempt. Perhaps in time as I gain more experience with coding it will be useful.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Reading error messages : <span class="rating-tag">Somewhat confident</span></h4>
        <p>
          Error messages are hard to avoid in Repl.it where we solve the katas on. I usually
          read them or at least skim for the necessary details. Many times from reading the
          error messages I've been able to fix the problem, sometimes by combining what I gather
          from the error message with another approach like trial and error. At times though I
          can barely understand the messages so in these instances I don't find them useful.

        <h4>Console.logging : <span class="rating-tag">Confident</span></h4>
        <p>
          I used this a lot during the freeCodeCamp lessons once I figured it out and found it
          really helped being able to see what a function was doing. I used it heaps during the
          katas as well. There have been times though when I have used the method incorrectly as
          I'm still learning. In general though it's a great tool especially for trying things.

        <br>
        <h4>Google search : <span class="rating-tag">Somewhat confident</span></h4>
        <p>
          I've found that using Google search can be a hit and miss; that there's an art to it
          that I've yet to discover. There have been times I've found the right resources to 
          help me solve problems within a reasonable timeframe. Other times though no matter how 
          many attempts I make at changing my search terms I wasn't able to pull up the right 
          resources. It's still a go to but I definitely need to refine my Google search skills 
          so it'll be more helpful for me.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Asking peers for help : <span class="rating-tag">Confident</span></h4>
        <p>
          Earlier on during EDA Foundations I reflected that I need to work on asking for help and
          I had a revelation about it this week. After being blocked for a while, I asked a
          friend who's a web developer if he could help me out with one function over video call.
          We walked through and worked out every step to pass the rest of the test together.
          I was able to ask him a lot of questions, he checked my understanding, explained
          concepts using useful analogies and got me to try things to see what would happen.
          Once we passed the tests he got me to loop back what I understood each line of
          the final solution was doing and clarified things further.

          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what collaboration looks like. It took almost an hour and a half but as a
          newbie with zero experience with JavaScript prior to last week, this way of bouncing
          off questions and explanations and trial and error with someone more experienced in
          JavaScript was incredibly useful and energising.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Asking facilitators for help : <span class="rating-tag">Somewhat confident</span></h4>
        <p>
          I asked my facilitator for help a few times in the last two weeks when I got so
          blocked for hours it felt debilitating. I told myself earlier on during Foundations to
          only do it as a last resort. Recently though I've come to realise that as a complete
          beginner in JavaScript there's no shame in asking the facilitators for help as I'm
          still learning. Sometimes I don't know what I don't know and one of the reasons I
          chose EDA is the support available from the facilitators due to small numbers of
          students in the cohorts. In all honesty the barrier to my asking the facilitators for
          help is actually feeling like I'm useless for having to do so.

        <h4>Improving process with reflection : <span class="rating-tag">Confident</span></h4>
        <p>
          I spend a lot of time on the reflections we are asked to write, mainly to benefit my
          own learning. At first it seemed like a lot of work but after a while I realised that
          while it can be time consuming and uncomfortable it's often helped me identify areas
          of improvement. Knowing about these means I can come up with new ways of approaching
          problems and I gain a different perspective. Hindsight is a powerful thing.
