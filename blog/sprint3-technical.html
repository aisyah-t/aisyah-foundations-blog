        <h3>The difference between HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used to provide the structure of a website and
          its content like text and images. Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is then used to transform
          how the content of the website looks and behaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's think of HTML as a house. It has doors and windows, hallway, living room,
          dining room, kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms, a laundry and maybe a porch at the front
          or at the back. All of these things make up the structure of the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it's all good and well having a house but inside it needs to be fitted and
          furnished to make it liveable as a home.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make it a home you need to decide on the interior fixtures and fittings, furniture 
          and so on. You may also decide on a design style like contemporary or industrial, 
          a colour palette and statement pieces. These all make up the interior
          design of the house; we can think of CSS as such. CSS is used to change and
          style the content of a website in various ways.

        <h3>The DOM and why it is useful</h3>
        <p>
          The Document Object Model (DOM) is an object-oriented structural representation of
          an HTML document as interpreted by your browser. The objects represented are valid
          HTML elements which make up the structural content of a website. It's also smart
          in that it will automatically add or correct elements that may not be present in an
          HTML document to make it a valid object. This is similar to spell check in Word 
          correcting the grammar and syntax of a document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOM represents the objects in a tree structure, similar to a family tree.
          Like a family tree, it shows the relationships between each object, from the parent
          to child branches, which may have leaves. Below is an example of a DOM tree by
          <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">Birger Eriksson / CC BY-SA</a>.
          <img src="../images/DOM-model.jpeg" width="500" alt="Example of a DOM tree structure">
        </p>
        <p>
          So how is the DOM relevant to a website? Previously I established that HTML and CSS
          can create a pretty good-looking website. However on their own they can only create
          a static website. To make a website engaging you'd probably want to add some
          interactive features. Going back to the analogy of the house, you may want to have
          cool features like clap sensor lights and remote-controlled blinds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The good news is that for a website you can add interactive features using JavaScript.
          This is where the DOM comes in handy. JavaScript is an object-oriented programming
          language. This means that it relies on the DOM tree structure to grab an object, 
          so to speak. Once it has that object it can manipulate it to make it interactive.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example you may use JavaScript to add animation to a website. The GIF below
          shows the difference JavaScript can make. HTML provides the structural outline 
          of a gator illustration. CSS comes along and adds features and colours inside the 
          outline to turn it into a blue-yellow gator. Add JavaScript on top and you can have 
          moving love hearts coming out of the gator. Pretty neat, right?

        <h3>JavaScript concepts explained through examples from everyday life</h3>
        <p>
          Before I dive into loop, control flow and several other concepts in JavaScript,
          keep in mind that JavaScript is a language that tells a computer to do something.
          Unlike humans, computers don't have intuition on how to perform tasks.
          They need to be told the exact step-by-step instructions (i.e. codes) on how
          to do something.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>JavaScript: Loop</h3>
        <p>
          Normally a line of code tells the computer to do one thing but there may be times
          when you need it to run the same code multiple times. A loop in JavaScript tells the
          computer to repeat an action some number of times.
        </p>
        <p>
          In everyday life, there are tasks you would perform multiple times in one go.
          Let's say you have some friends over and you've made carrot cake for everyone to
          share. You need to cut the cake into the right number of slices for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          You wouldn't pick up the cake knife, cut one slice of the carrot cake, put the knife
          down and repeat the whole process over and over until you have enough slices.
          Instead you would decide how many slices of cake you need, grab the cake knife,
          cut the cake into the required number of slices and then put the knife down once
          you're done.
        </p>
        <p>
          A computer would do the former unless you tell it to do the latter, in this instance
          by using a loop. Let's say you need to tell it to slice the cake six times.
          You might write a loop code like the one below to make the computer do so.
        </p>
        <pre>
          // Slice cake loop

          for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            console.log("Slice cake");
           }

           // Expected output:
           "Slice cake"
           "Slice cake"
           "Slice cake"
           "Slice cake"
           "Slice cake"
           "Slice cake"
        </pre>
        <br>

        <h3>JavaScript: Control flow</h3>
        <p>
          A computer reads and executes code in the order that the code has been designed to do.
          Often though, we want it to run a code only if something is true or not.
          Control flow asks the computer to check if something is true and then either run the
          code supplied if it is or move on if it's not. An example of control flow in
          JavaScript is the conditional statement <code>if...else</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's go back to the friends you have over and the carrot cake slices. Before serving 
          them to your friends, you ask each of them if they want yoghurt with their slice of 
          carrot cake. <em>If</em> they do you would add yoghurt to the plate with their cake, 
          <em>else</em> you wouldn't. In this case, below is an example of an 
          <code>if...else</code> code you'd write for the computer.
        </p>
        <pre>
          // Yoghurt with cake if...else control flow statement

          if (friendWantsYoghurt == true) {
            addYoghurt(); // Add yoghurt to plate with cake slice
          } else { 
            doNothing();  // Don't add yoghurt to plate with cake slice
          }
        </pre>
        <br>

        <h3>JavaScript: Array and accessing data from an array</h3>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, an array stores a range of data in an index sequence. You can access
          a data in an array by referencing its index using bracket notation. The index in an
          array starts from 0, which means the first data has an index of 0, the second data
          has an index of 1 and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember those friends you have over and they each have a slice of cake, with or
          without yoghurt? They may also like to have a hot drink with the cake. Imagine
          you're super organised and in the kitchen, all your hot drink options are perfectly 
          lined up next to each other. In an array, you would tell the computer that the line 
          of hot drinks looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
          // Array of hot drinks options in sequential order

          hotDrinksArray = ["coffee", "black tea", "green tea", "chai latte"]
        </pre>
        <p>
          Given that you instinctively know the exact position of each drink option in the 
          line, you'd be able to grab the drink you need without looking at the labels. 
          To tell the computer to get a certain hot drink from the array you would reference 
          its index position in the array using bracket notation as below:
        </p>
        <pre>
          // Get a drink from hotDrinksArray

          hotDrinksArray[0]; // Get "coffee"
          hotDrinksArray[1]; // Get "black tea"
          hotDrinksArray[2]; // Get "green tea"
          hotDrinksArray[3]; // Get "chai latte"
        </pre>
        <br>
        <h3>JavaScript: Object and accessing data from an object</h3>
        <p>
          Object is another way to store a range of data in JavaScript. Instead of storing data
          in an index sequence, an object stores data using named properties that have assigned
          values. You can access properties of an object with a simple dot-notation or
          bracket notation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's go back to your friends, their slice of cake and the hot drink they may like
          to have. Now let's say you're not that organised, so each of the hot drink
          options are stored in different parts of the kitchen and you know where each drink 
          can be found. In an object, you would tell the computer the location (named property) 
          and the hot drink in it (value) like below:
        </p>
        <pre>
          // Object specifying location of hot drinks options in kitchen

          hotDrinksLocationObject = {
            kitchenCounter: "coffee",
            topShelf: "black tea",
            middleShelf: "green tea",
            bottomShelf: "chai latte",
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          Now that you've defined the location of each hot drink to the computer in an object,
          you would tell it to get a specific drink by pairing the object and property names 
          using dot notation like so:
        </p>
        <pre>
          // Get a drink from hotDrinksLocationObject using dot notation

          hotDrinksLocationObject.kitchenCounter; // Get "coffee"
          hotDrinksLocationObject.topShelf;       // Get "black tea"
          hotDrinksLocationObject.middleShelf;    // Get "green tea"
          hotDrinksLocationObject.bottomShelf;    // Get "chai latte"
        </pre>
        <p>
          You can also use bracket notation for the property name instead, as shown in 
          the example below. Normally you only need to do this if the property name has 
          special characters or spaces. Make sure you also wrap the property name in single 
          or double quotes if using bracket notation.
        </p>
        <pre>
          // Get a drink from hotDrinksLocationObject using bracket notation

          hotDrinksLocationObject['kitchenCounter']; // Get "coffee"
        </pre>
        <br>
        <!--As if talking to a non-technical friend, explain what functions are 
          and why they are useful.-->
        <h3>JavaScript: Function and why it is important</h3>
        <p>
          A function is a group of sequential instructions that can be used (called) as many 
          times as you like. You create (declare) a function by giving it a name, then specify 
          the things you would like it to do. Once a function has been created (declared), 
          you can use (call) it any time, as many times as you like, simply by using its name 
          instead rewriting the same code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going back to the analogy of friends and cake, you could technically create a 
          function that instructs a computer to: slice the cake, place each slice on its 
          own plate, put yoghurt on the plate or not depending on each friend's preference 
          and so on. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          You're likely to have friends over again for cake and hot drinks, so having a 
          function declared in the computer means you can quickly call the function to get the 
          computer to perform the tasks in it. You can also update the function with a new 
          number of cake slices to cut, yoghurt preferences and so on when you reuse it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see, a function is a very efficient way of grouping codes that can be 
          used (called) anytime. You can even vary the parameters in a function when it is 
          reused. This can save developers a lot of time when they are coding a website etc. 
          and this is why it is important.
