            <h3>Describe your personal core values</h3>

        </p>
            From a mix of self-evaluation, speaking to people I trust and using an online values evaluation tool, 
            the personal core values that are important to me at this stage in my life revolve around:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Independence and agency</strong>: It’s important for me to have autonomy in deciding how I’d like to live my life 
                    and what I’d like to do and to have ownership of my time and pursuits.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Growth and learning</strong>: I thrive in situations where I am learning new things and in supportive environments 
                    that allow me to develop new skills and grow personally.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Integrity</strong>: I value honest and transparent communication, doing the right thing and following through on your words 
                    and responsibility.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Persistence and work ethic</strong>: I believe in not giving up when things get tough and that putting in consistent effort 
                    towards achieving a goal will eventually pay off.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Humility and gratitude</strong>: I believe in letting actions and achievements speak for themselves and that it’s important 
                    to be grateful for the people who help you along in your journey.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Social and environmental responsibility</strong>: I strive to make life choices that help minimise less than preferable impacts 
                    on the wider community and the environment such as through purchasing fair trade or locally produced goods whenever possible.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
            the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>

            <p>
                I’d like to think that I stay true to myself when making decisions and trust that this way the outcomes won’t have negative impacts.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can think of a situation relating to a previous job that I left as I was very unhappy there for various reasons. 
                Regardless of this I had a few substantial achievements during my short time in the job, had a great working relationship with the manager and left on good terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                However not long after I left, I found out from a former colleague that several people had uncovered some unethical things 
                that the manager had done behind their backs. Without going into details, finding out about these things had me 
                re-thinking whether I should keep in contact with him. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One the one hand, the things that he had done were very questionable and showed that he had no integrity. 
                On the other hand, we had a good working relationship and he would be a great referee for future job hunts and 
                could introduce me to valuable connections in the tech industry, which is an industry I had thought about 
                breaking into at the time.
            </p>
            <p> 
                I knew that keeping in contact with him would tug at my conscience even though I didn’t personally have problems with him. 
                So I decided that the best thing to do would be to stop all contact with the manager. 
                I chose not to associate myself with someone who lacks integrity.    
            </p>
            <p>
                I suppose the consequences are that I lost a good referee and the potential of making valuable connections 
                to people in the tech industry. 
                However I can’t justify keeping in touch with him for my personal benefit given that he has displayed values 
                that are counter to mine.    
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>

            <p>
                Cultural and identity exploration is something I’ve come across many times, initially through my university studies 
                many years ago and I’ve thought about identity often. 
                For the sake of simplifying things, having lived a rather transient life means I can somewhat identify with being an 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid">Adult Third Culture Kid (ATCK)</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given this, I would say my values and identity have been shaped by a mixture of life experiences including the various places 
                and cultures I have lived in, the education systems I have gone through, the people I have met and/or developed relationships 
                with at various points and contexts in my life, the various work experiences I’ve had and my Muay Thai practice. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years I have adopted values that resonate with me and identified values I don’t want to associate with. 
                All of these make up my individual culture which emphasises this non-exhaustive list of things: 
                <em>respect, lifetime learning, equality and fairness, humility, empathy and embracing diversity.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally, I think values and identity are intertwined with my ever-changing life experiences and so they are always 
                a work in progress and therefore can be rather fluid.    
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h3>

            <p>
                A good friend said to me that I’m a clear communicator as she finds it easy to understand me whenever I explain something to her.
                Being able to get clear messages across to different people is a strength that should help me throughout my learning 
                and career journey. It's also an important skill for me to keep refining.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same friend also told me that I thoroughly think things through and that I make something big seem less scary 
                by breaking it into small chunks in order to achieve my goal. Being methodical is a good thing as it means I don’t rush 
                into things and make sure that I understand what needs to be done.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tying into this, I am self-motivated and I follow through on things I say I would do. 
                I hope being reliable means I will develop productive working relationships with others.
            <p>
                In terms of limitations, I'm rather goal-oriented and coupled with being thorough I can get into situations 
                where I put pressure on myself and sometimes others to achieve something. 
                I’m constantly working on knowing when to stop myself from digging further into an abyss and telling myself I’ve done enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I also have a strong independent streak this may lead me to eventually pursue self-employment or remote work instead of 
                a role in a traditional office environment. 
                This also means I need to consciously put effort in reaching out more to people to assist with my learning and career development.
            </p>    
            <br>

            <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
            
            <p>
                I think my ability to break down things into small chunks in order to achieve something will help me 
                in my learning journey when it comes to solving coding problems. 
                The caveat is that I can sometimes overthink things, like I have with this whole exercise! 
                It may also stop me from getting into a state of flow with my learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being self-motivated and self-reliant would mean I would research what needs to be done to fix something 
                if I get stuck and figure things out on my own in order to get something done. 
                However as previously explained this could mean that I may wait too long to ask for help and I need to be conscious of this.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, 
                but there was resistance or tension. 
                Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies 
                you would try now, and why.
            </h3>

            <p>
                When I first started my first full-time job managing volunteers several years ago, there was one returning volunteer I had 
                difficulty working productively with. 
                He seemed to lack interest in getting involved during team meetings and didn’t keep in touch with me regularly 
                like the other volunteers did. 
                Regular communication with the volunteers was important to ensure that services were being delivered in a timely manner.
            </p>   
            <p>
                My predecessor recruited the cohort of volunteers so I barely knew anything about them. 
                I decided to organise one-to-one catch ups with each volunteer to get to know them and check in on how things were going. 
                This allowed me to connect with the volunteer mentioned above and made things less awkward between us temporarily. 
                However I didn’t organise further individual catch ups for that trimester and things didn’t get much better 
                in terms of his engagement and communication with me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I was young and I now know that this was a flawed way of approaching the situation. 
                If I were in this situation again, I would try other strategies like organising regular catch ups and 
                initiating more communication with the volunteer. 
                It’d also be useful to have an honest discussion about our expectations of our working relationship 
                and on how we could work well together. 
                I could also regularly use the team meetings as a safe space to reflect on things like expectations 
                and to gather feedback on how things were going etc. 

            </p>
            <p>
                These strategies are proactive ways of dealing with the issue and could’ve helped improve 
                my working relationship with the volunteer.
                They also include a mix of individual and team discussions; some people will tell you things in group situations 
                but others will only do so on a one-to-one basis.
