        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence, commonly referred to as Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EQ), is the ability to
          recognise, manage, evaluate and express one's own emotions as well as interpret, understand
          and respond appropriately to others' emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having strong emotional intelligence means that one is aware of their own emotions and
          can identify and understand why they feel the way they do, as well as recognise others' emotions and
          what may contribute to these and empathise with how they are feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          In emotionally-charged situations, people who are emotionally intelligent are able to take the time
          to establish all the different things that are happening and respond appropriately.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>
          IQ stands for Intelligence Quotient, which is used to determine intellectual abilities such as
          logical reasoning, word comprehension, mathematical skills and abstract and spatial thinking.
          It is solely about the "book smart" aspects of a person which can be determined through tools such as aptitude
          tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the workplace, IQ can be manifested as the ability to complete challenging tasks, perform research,
          analyse and make connections between facts, amongst other "hard skills."
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, EQ in the workplace relates to "soft skills" which can mean the ability to collaborate and
          work well with others in a team, negotiate, lead others and build and maintain strong working relationships.
        </p>
        An emotionally intelligent person is highly self-aware and has the ability to manage emotions and situations
        to achieve desirable and fair outcomes. Someone who has a high IQ and the ability to perform "hard skills" well
        may not necessarily have a decent level of EQ.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Why is Emotional Intelligence important?</h3>
        <p>
          There are many reasons why Emotional Intelligence is important and a few of these relate to how it affects:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Physical and mental health</strong>: When someone is able to recognise, manage and work through
              their emotions it means they can manage their stress levels effectively.
              Someone who's unable to manage stress levels is more prone to developing health issues such as high blood
              pressure,
              increased risk of heart attacks and strokes and weakened immune system. They would also be vulnerable to
              developing
              mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Personal relationships</strong>: People with high emotional intelligence have the social skills
              to form and maintain strong relationships with others.
              Someone who's unable to understand, get comfortable with and manage their emotions is likely to struggle
              with
              forming strong relationships and they can get defensive in uncomfortable situations.
              This can make them feel isolated which can make them vulnerable to becoming mentally unwell.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance at work</strong>: Employees at a workplace have various different personalities,
              skills, strengths
              and emotions. Someone who's emotionally intelligent can recognise the dynamics amongst people in the
              workplace and
              empathise with their colleagues' feelings and perspectives. This enables them to communicate and
              collaborate more
              effectively and productively with others therefore produce high quality work.
              They are more resilient when things don't go to plan and adaptable to change, which is invaluable in this
              day
              and age where things can change quickly.
