        <h3>What is neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity refers to the ability of the brain to adapt and rewire its connections
          as a result of our interactions with the environment. When we learn something new,
          our brain forms new connections and pathways, effectively rewiring itself to adapt
          to new circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          The human brain is malleable; it is constantly adapting and rewiring its pathways in
          response to the environment and the things we are exposed to. Contrary to popular belief, 
          the brain doesn't actually stop adapting and developing beyond the developmental 
          period of childhood. This means that there are ways for adults to encourage and 
          stimulate neuroplasticity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two-minute video below from the Sentis Brain Animation Series sums up
          neuroplasticity nicely.

        <h3>Benefits of understanding and engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
          When people, especially adults, understand neuroplasticity they know that the adult
          brain isn't fixed to only be able to do and think certain things. Being aware that
          the brain is constantly being reshaped by our environment and what we do and think
          is a powerful thing. It can make people realise that it is possible for anyone 
          to learn and develop new skills or change existing habits and ways of thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          For people like me traversing the complex world of web development as a beginner,
          engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity is highly beneficial for my learning.
          I now have the understanding that when I learn something new and practise it
          regularly, my brain will form new pathways required to perform coding tasks. 
          It means the more I learn and practise web development codes, the easier it will 
          come to me as the brain pathways required for coding grow over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that means practice, practice, practice and practice some more is absolutely key
          for my learning. Outside of the course requirements, I will practise by refining the
          codes for my homepage and blogs and using coding resources such as edabit.

        <h3>Some ways to increase neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
          As previously mentioned, there are ways that we can stimulate and encourage
          neuroplasticity. Some of these include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Travel</strong>: When you travel you expose your brain to new and
              complex environments. Being exposed to new and challenging situations will
              fire off new neurons in your brain.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Sleep</strong>: Sleep helps with learning and memory retention. Getting
              7 to 8 hours of quality sleep per night helps your brain connect cells and
              transfer information across them.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Exercise</strong>: Regular mild to moderate exercise promotes the growth
              of neurons in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is a part of the brain responsible
              for learning and memory, and it is activated during exercise.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Mindfulness</strong>: Regularly practising mindfulness meditation rewires
              your brain as your feelings and thoughts change towards a more pleasant outlook.
              The more your brain changes the more you react to things with a sense of calm,
              compassion and awareness.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>

          If you're interested in more information about neuroplasticity, I found this article 
          from Positive Psychology - <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/">

          exploring the concept.

        <br>
        <h3>What is growth mindset and why is it relevant?</h3>
        <p>
          Growth mindset is connected to neuroplasticity; it's the understanding that one's
          skills, talents and abilities are not fixed and can be developed and improved through
          dedication and hard work. Having a growth mindset means believing that we can get
          better at something we may not be good at through consistent sustained effort.
          Someone who has a growth mindset may achieve more than others as they place
          importance on the learning process and putting in the time to actually learn or
          improve skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having a growth mindset is particularly relevant for me as I go through my learning
          journey. It's important for me to keep in mind that putting in the time and effort 
          to learn and practise all these new skills will be worth it, and that challenges, 
          making mistakes and asking for help are part of the learning process.
        </p>

        <h3>Things that changed for me during my exploration of growth mindset</h3>
        <p>
          The first thing that stuck with me when I was exploring the topic of growth mindset
          is the importance of valuing the learning process over the end result.
          This involves making mistakes, sometimes lots of it and in front of others,
          and asking for help. When you're comfortable with these you'll find it easier
          to step back, analyse where things may have gone wrong and reflect on what you
          have learned and need to do differently next time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other thing I came across is that displaying your ability to do something first
          can help you grow confidence in your ability. Rather than the adage of, "Believe
          that you can do it first then you'll be able to do it," you can actually develop 
          confidence and perseverance by doing something that proves to yourself that you can 
          do it. No matter how tiny it may seem, small wins repeated over time can lead to a
          growth mindset. The key is to actually do something rather than get trapped into 
          thinking that you can't do it.

        <h3>How I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey</h3>
        <p>
          My EDA journey so far has challenged me substantially, especially during Sprint 3.
          Despite the frustrations, I firmly believe that growth only happens outside of the 
          comfort zone. I've also learned through my Muay Thai practice that consistency and 
          effort matter. They are key to making incremental improvements, even if it's 
          only 1% improvement at a time. These are things that I will continue to bring along 
          with me during my time at EDA.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few practical ways I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use and emphasise the phrase "not yet" more often when I come across blocks.
            This will remind me to keep plugging away at it and to trust the process.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            View these blocks as a part of the learning process and an opportunity to learn
            how to solve problems, and to let go of my stubborn ego and ask others
            for help in time.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Put in the time to practice, practice, practice especially with JavaScript. I will 
            research JavaScript coding practice resources, decide on a few that work best for my 
            learning style and set aside time to actually practise coding.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Actively ask for feedback and learn to evaluate feedback objectively, which may
            require looking for further information to establish whether it is valid.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
