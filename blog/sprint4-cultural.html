        <h3>What is neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity refers to the ability of the brain to adapt and rewire its connections  
          as a result of our interactions with the environment. When we learn something new, 
          our brain form new connections and pathways, effectively rewiring our brain to adapt 
          to new circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our brain is malleable; it is constantly adapting and rewiring its pathways in 
          response to the environments and things we are exposed to. The brain doesn't actually 
          stop adapting and developing beyond the developmental period of childhood. This means 
          that there are ways for adults to encourage and stimulate neuroplasticity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two-minute video below from the Sentis Brain Animation Series sums up
          neuroplasticity concisely.

        <h3>Benefits of understanding and engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
          When people, especially adults, understand neuroplasticity they know that the adult 
          brain isn't fixed to only be able to do and think certain things. Understanding that 
          the brain is constantly being reshaped by our environment and what we do and think 
          is a powerful concept. It can make people see that it is possible for anyone to learn 
          and develop new skills or change existing habits and mindsets.
        </p>
        <p>
          For people like me traversing the complex world of web development as a beginner, 
          engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity is beneficial for my learning. 
          I now have the understanding that when I learn something new and practise it 
          regularly, my brain will form new or enlarge existing pathways required 
          to perform the tasks. It means the more I learn and practise web development codes, 
          the easier it will come to me as the required brain pathways grow over time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So that means practice, practice, practice and practice some more is absolutely key 
          for my learning. Outside of the course requirements, I will practise by refining the 
          codes for my homepage and blogs and using coding resources such as edabit.

        <h3>Some ways to increase neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
          As previously mentioned, there are ways that we can stimulate and encourage 
          neuroplasticity. Some of these include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Travel</strong>: When you travel you expose your brain to new and 
              complex environments. These new and challenging situations fire off new neurons 
              in your brain.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Sleep</strong>: Sleep helps with learning and memory retention. Getting 
              7 to 8 hours of quality sleep per night assists your brain to connect cells and 
              transfer information across them.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Exercise</strong>: Regular mild to moderate exercise promotes the growth 
              of neurons in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is a part of the brain responsible 
              for learning and memory, and it is activated during exercise.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Mindfulness</strong>: Regularly practising mindfulness meditation rewires 
              your brain as your feelings and thoughts change towards a more pleasant outlook. 
              The more your brain changes the more you react to things with a sense of calm, 
              compassion and awareness.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          If you're interested in more information about neuroplasticity, I found that this  
          article from Positive Psychology - <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/">

          exploring the concept.

        <h3>What is growth mindset and why is it relevant?</h3>
        <p>
          Growth mindset is connected to neuroplasticity; it's the understanding that one's 
          skills, talents and abilities are not fixed and can be developed and improved through 
          dedication and hard work. Having a growth mindset means believing that we can get 
          better at something we may not be good at through consistent sustained effort. 
          Someone who has a growth mindset may achieve more than others as they place 
          importance on the learning process and putting in the time to actually learn or 
          improve skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having a growth mindset is particularly relevant for me as I go through my learning 
          journey. It's important for me to recognise that putting in the time and 
          effort to learn and practice all these new skills will be worth it, and to accept 
          that challenges, making mistakes and asking for help are part of the learning 
          process.
        </p>

        <h3>Things that changed for me during my exploration of growth mindset</h3>
        <p>
          The first thing that stuck with me when I was exploring the topic of growth mindset 
          is the importance of valuing the learning process over the end result itself. 
          This involves making mistakes, sometimes lots of it and in front of others, 
          and asking for help. When you're comfortable with these you'll find it easier 
          to step back and analyse where things may have gone wrong and reflect on what you 
          have learned and need to do differently next time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The other thing I learned is that displaying your ability to do something first 
          can help you grow confidence in your ability. Rather than the old adage of, "Believe 
          in yourself first then you can do great things," you can actually develop confidence 
          and perseverance by doing something that proves to yourself that you can do it. 
          No matter how tiny it may seem, small wins repeated over time can lead to a 
          growth mindset.

        <h3>How I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey</h3>
        <p>
          My EDA journey so far has challenged me substantially, especially during Sprint 3. 
          Despite the frustrations I know that growth only happens out of my comfort zone. 
          This is something I firmly believe in and I've also learned through my Muay Thai 
          practice that consistency and effort are the things that will help me improve. 
          These are lessons that I will continue to bring with me in my learning journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few practical ways I will integrate growth mindset into my journey are:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use and emphasise the phrase "not yet" more often when I come across blocks in my learning 
              journey. This will remind me to keep plugging away at it and to trust the process.
            </li>
            <li>
              View these blocks as a part of the learning process and an opportunity to learn how to 
              solve problems and also when to let go of my stubborn ego and ask others for help. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Actively ask for feedback and learn to evaluate feedback objectively, which may 
              require looking for further information to establish whether it is valid.
            </li>
          </ul>
